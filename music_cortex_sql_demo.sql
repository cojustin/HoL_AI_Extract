ðŸŽµ MUSIC INDUSTRY AI ANALYSIS COMPLETE! ðŸŽµ

This demo shows the full power of Snowflake's Cortex AI functions:

âœ… AI_EXTRACT: Extract structured data from music documents (press releases, bios)
âœ… AI_CLASSIFY: Categorize artists by career stage and musical style  
âœ… AI_FILTER: Match artists with appropriate venues based on compatibility
âœ… AI_SENTIMENT: Analyze review sentiment across multiple aspects
âœ… AI_AGG: Discover industry trends and patterns across documents
âœ… PARSE_DOCUMENT: Convert documents to searchable text

Featured Artists: Sarah Jarosz, Billy Strings, Sturgill Simpson, 
Kitchen Dwellers, Paul Cauthen, Greensky Bluegrass, Daniel Donato

Business Applications:
- A&R Intelligence: Identify emerging artists and trends
- Music Discovery: Extract artist similarities and influences  
- Fan Sentiment Analysis: Process reviews and social media
- Venue Analytics: Match artists to appropriate venues
- Rights Management: Extract metadata from contracts
- Festival Programming: Analyze artist compatibility

The pattern follows the exact structure of the colleague's example:
1. Stage setup and document upload
2. Single document AI_EXTRACT 
3. Batch processing multiple documents
4. Parse documents with PARSE_DOCUMENT
5. Combine parsing and extraction to create structured tables
6. Use AI_FILTER for intelligent matching
7. AI_CLASSIFY for categorization
8. AI_AGG for trend analysis across documents
9. AI_SENTIMENT for review analysis
10. Comprehensive dashboard combining all functions
